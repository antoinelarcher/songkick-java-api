Hello you.

This is a very simple Java API to the Songkick service.

I wanted to play with Songkick, but realised I'd need something like this to do so.

To use it:

Songkick sk = new Songkick(YOUR_API_KEY);
List<Artist> = sk.getArtists("radiohead);
List<Location> = sk.getLocationsByName("brighton");

etc etc. The public methods are all in com.songkick.api.Songkick

The project lives at http://code.google.com/p/songkick-java-api/

You can get an API key from http://www.songkick.com/api_key_requests/new
